            TOPIC:
Analyzing 3D / 360 Technology Through the Lens of Journalism <p>
          
<p>
HYPOTHESIS:
The art of journalism cannot effectively use 3D / 360 technology for new stories due to improper or expensive equipment, slow processors, and complex platforms to view the final product. <p>

          <p>
METHOD:
Surveying 3D / 360 effectiveness by comparing advanced technology with everyday technology by scanning the same space with different platforms for 3D acquisitions and viewing. The advanced technology in this experiment is a software called DocuSketch, used by restoration and construction professionals around the world. Everyday technology in this experiment is the 3D scanning apps of MagiScan and Trnio Plus on an iPhone 12, as well as a panoramic picture also taken on an iPhone 12. The space used in this experiment is the kitchen in a residential home that recently experienced a fire. <p>

          <p>
OPINION:
When comparing the kitchen room through the four different platforms, it is obvious that DocuSketch is miles ahead of the iPhone’s scanning equipment. As a matter of fact, miles ahead is an understatement. Before I continue with my tirade, I want to make clear that this was expected, I am not naïve in thinking that iPhone’s and DocuSketch should be on the same level. The argument here is that journalists should be given a higher standard than just an app on a smartphone. Newsroom budgets are non-existent…well actually, newsrooms themselves are slowly crawling towards extinction. But shouldn’t we value journalism more rather than allowing for this trend of a thin supply of journalists? And more central to this argument, shouldn’t we value journalism more for their historic purpose of informing the public? As a public that relies on journalism to inform us, shouldn’t we care about having packed newsrooms, full of journalists and fueled by healthy budgets? <p>

          <p>
I digress… <p>

          <p>
When using an iPhone 12 for 3D scanning, both apps had holes in the final product in that only the broad and well-lit areas of the room were properly uploaded to the image. Everything else was missing. The DocuSketch software, however, was the fullest image with no holes or lack of light which allowed for the full picture of the house. Full being a key word in this comparison because you can really get the view of the house in its entirety and go room-to-room in the virtual tour provided by the software. It is also worth mentioning that DocuSketch is quick and fluid with little-to-no lag in the transitions. When uploading and viewing the images through an iPhone, you can tell that the speed processors are very different and much slower and even clunky. There’s lag, difficulty in navigating, and unfavorable viewpoints of where you are trying to look. These problems pose as a threat to journalistic practices with this software. 
Journalism can not yet sufficiently tell stories relevant to American society through 3D / 360 technology because of the issues posed by daily or free technology. Even the most skilled journalists will run into trouble when trying to publish a story using the previously mentioned equipment. I also think accessibility is another key issue. DocuSketch and other professional 3D / 360 equipment is harshly priced, leaving journalists to turn to free and more accessible software, which is less than optimal to tell stories of relevant news to our society. <p>

          <p>
CONCLUSION:
Journalism is at its most crucial point in history, as the American society continues to battle journalism ethics, misinformation, and deteriorating newsrooms. Therefore, expediting the progression of this technology and equipment, not just for civilian use but to garner the technology for the purpose of journalism, will help our society be more informed with accurate reporting and first-person viewing of different stories. The goal of journalism is to inform the public of relevant news and information. 3D / 360 viewing of different areas or stories will help our society to have a more informed perspective of what is happening in the world around us. The silver lining is that, since the turn to the 21st century, technology has rapidly grown and expanded, redefining what is possible. This rapid growth may mean that we are not too far away from better 3D / 360 equipment, which also means that our most-informed society is just over the horizon.  <p>
